# 2048 Game
Exercise your resourcefulness and brainpower with a simple and fun classic 2048 Game :game_die:

To succeed, you need to double the value of the tiles by combining the two identical ones until you reach the goal - successfully generate the tile with the value of 2048 :trophy:

**Game Features:**
- Click the "Start" / "Restart" button to begin a new game.
- The game field is displayed as a 4x4 grid filled with numbered and empty tiles.
- The tiles can be moved with keyboard arrows with every next move generating a new tile with the value of either "2" or "4" (the probability of "4" is 10%).
- The values of the tiles range from "2" to "2048" (the succession of 2, 4, 8 ... 2^n).
- While moving, the pairs of tiles with equal values merge into a single one with a doubled value.
- The "Score" field immediately displays the sum of all merged tiles.
- The game is lost when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.
